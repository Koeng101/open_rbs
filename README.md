RBS calculation takes 5 basic parameters:

1. dG-mRNA:rRNA
2. dG-start
3. dG-spacing
4. dG-standby
5. dG-mRNA


## dG-mRNA:rRNA
Idea: capture the energy in the basepairing between mRNA RBS and the SD sequence in the rRNA. This is energy gained by the system during ribosome assembly on the mRNA due to rRNA recognition. This captures (roughly) the "strength" of an RBS (as measured by gene expression).

## dG-start

## dG-spacing

## dG-standby

## dG-mRNA
